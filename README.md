# Open UI
A React component library containing both primitives and complex UI. Coming Soon!

# About
At the moment, this project is a work in progress.  We have combined primitive components from multiple React component libraries to make a completely open source UI component library that you can can use in your project!

## Integrations
- [Grommet UX](https://grommet.github.io/) - This library utilizes the fantastic Grommet UX Framework as a starting place. All grommet components are included and can be imported from the OpenUI library.

NOTE: to properly use this lib, you will need to import the base grommet stylesheets.  See `./source/examples/` for an example of the usage.

## Status
This is a brand new project and is totally experimental.  As it matures, we will release more information, including documentation.  Stay tuned!
